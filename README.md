This is an in depth analysis of four legendary funds and how they performed vrs the market. In this analysis I am using the S&P 500 as an indicator of the market. The data is presented as dataframes and visual plots to help the reader to understand several key metrics including daily returns, cumulative returns, annual percent change, and the covariance and betas of the four portfolios. I have used Pythons library Pandas to make the calculations and diplay the outcomes. This is an in depth analysis leveraging pandas of four massive financial funds and how they performed against the market from mid 2014 to mid 2020.


## Technologies

This Analysis uses Python 3.7 with the following packages:

``` pandas ```

``` pathlib ```

``` %matplotlib ```

``` numpy ```

``` python 3.7 ```

``` jupyter lab ```


---
## Installation Guide

This analysis was done with Pandas on Jupyter Lab. To interact with the functions, first install the following:

``` pip jupyter lab ```

``` pip install python 3.7 ```

---
## Usage

This analysis is meant to read and study to learn the performance of the four portfolios and how they performed against the market from 2014 to 2020, It is possible to replicate these functions for different data, but that would require borrowing the functions, or cloning the repository to your local computer and then including a new csv file that had the data the user wanted to analyse.
